Rstudio includes many features to improve the user’s experience.\nLet’s get familiar with RStudio.\n\nOpen R and RStudio\nFind the RStudio shortcut on your computer and fire it up. You should see something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are four panes in RStudio:\n\nSource: Your primary window for writing code to send to the console, this is where you write and save R “scripts”\nConsole: This is where code is executed in R\nEnvironment, History, etc.: A tabbed window showing your working environment, code execution history, and other useful things\nFiles, plots, etc.: A tabbed window showing a file explorer, a plot window, list of installed packages, help files, and viewer\n\n\n\nScripting\nIn most cases, you will not enter and execute code directly in the console. Code can be written in a script and then sent directly to the console.\nOpen a new script from the File menu…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecuting code in RStudio\nAfter you write code in an R script, it can be sent to the Console to run the code. There are two ways to do this. First, you can hit the Run button at the top right of the scripting window. Second, you can use ctrl+enter (cmd+enter on a Mac). Either option will run the line(s) of script that are selected."

The second bit, <-, is the assignment operator. This tells R to take the result of sum(rnorm(100)) and store it in an object named, my_random_sum. It is stored in the environment and can be used by just executing it’s name in the console.\n\nmy_random_sum\n\n[1] -13.64527\n\n\n\nWhat is the environment?\nThere are two outcomes when you run code. First, the code will simply print output directly in the console. Second, there is no output because you have stored it as a variable using <-. Output that is stored is saved in the environment. The environment is the collection of named objects that are stored in memory for your current R session."

As of 2023-01-21, there are 19082 packages on CRAN!\n\n\nInstalling packages\nWhen a package gets installed, that means the source code is downloaded and put into your library. A default library location is set for you.\nWe use the install.packages() function to download and install a package. Here, we install the readxl package, used below, which is used to upload data from and Excel file.\n\ninstall.packages(\"readxl\")\n\nYou should see some text in the R console showing progress of the installation and a prompt after installation is done.\nAfter installation, you can load a package using the library() function. This makes all functions in a package available for you to use.\n\nlibrary(readxl)\n\nWe also want to install MassWateR from CRAN.\n\n# Install the package\ninstall.packages(\"MassWateR\")\n\nAn important aspect of packages is that you only need to download them once, but every time you start RStudio you need to load them with the library() function."

    "text": "Data structures in R\nNow we can talk about R data structures. Simply put, a data structure is a way for programming languages to handle information storage.\n\nVectors (one-dimensional data)\nThe basic data format in R is a vector - a one-dimensional grouping of elements that have the same type. These are all vectors and they are created with the c (concatenate) function:\n\ndbl_var <- c(1, 2.5, 4.5)\nint_var <- c(1L, 6L, 10L)\nlog_var <- c(TRUE, FALSE, T, F)\nchr_var <- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\n\nThe four types of vectors are double (or numeric), integer, logical, and character. The following functions can return useful information about the vectors:\n\nclass(dbl_var)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nlength(log_var)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\n\n\nData frames (two-dimensional data)\nA collection of vectors represented as one data object are often described as two-dimensional data, like a spreadsheet, or in R speak, a data frame. Here’s a simple example:\n\nltrs <- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\nnums <- c(1, 2, 3)\nlogs <- c(T, F, T)\nmydf <- data.frame(ltrs, nums, logs)\nmydf\n\n  ltrs nums  logs\n1    a    1  TRUE\n2    b    2 FALSE\n3    c    3  TRUE\n\n\nThe only constraints required to make a data frame are:\n\nEach column (vector) contains the same type of data\nThe number of observations in each column is equal."
