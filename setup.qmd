title: "Setup R and RStudio"
---

Thanks for your interest in the [MassWateR](https://massbays-tech.github.io/MassWateR) R package. For the package workshops, we will be using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) as our interface to R. In order to participate in this testing, you will need to make sure you have R and RStudio installed on your computer.

Thanks to the [USGS-R Training group](https://owi.usgs.gov/R/training.html) and [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html) for making their installation materials available. The following instructions come directly from their materials, with a few minor edits to help you get set up.

## Install R and RStudio

**R** and **RStudio** are separate downloads and installations. R is the underlying statistical computing software. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier and more interactive. *You need to install R before you install RStudio*.

### *Windows*: Download and install R

Go to [CRAN and download](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/) the R installer for Windows. Make sure to choose the latest stable version (v4.2.2 as of January 2023).

Once the installer downloads, Right-click on it and select "Run as administrator".

Type in your credentials and click yes (or if you don't have administrator access have your IT rep install with Admin privileges).

You can click next through the standard dialogs and accept most defaults. But at the destination screen, please verify that it is installing it to C:\\Program Files\\R

![](figure/install_destination.png)

At the "Select Components" screen, you can accept the default and install both 32-bit and 64-bit versions.

At this screen, uncheck 'Create a desktop icon' because non-admin users in Windows will be unable to delete it.

### *Windows*: Download and install RStudio

Download RStudio from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

After download, double-click the installer. It will ask for your administrator credentials to install (you might need to have your IT rep install again).

Accept all the default options for the RStudio install.

### *macOS*: Download and install R

-   Download and install R from the CRAN website for Mac [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/).
-   Select the `.pkg` file for the latest R version
-   Double click on the downloaded file to install R
-   It is also a good idea to install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) (needed by some packages)

### *macOS*: Download and install RStudio

-   Go to the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) download page
-   Under Installers select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Mac OS X 10.6+ (64-bit)** (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
-   Double click the file to install RStudio

## Check Install

### Open RStudio

Once installed, RStudio should be accessible from the start menu. Start up RStudio. Once running it should look something like this:

## Install MassWateR (optional)

The MassWateR package can be installed from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) by running the code below in the RStudio console. The installation will also be covered during the workshop.

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Install the package
install.packages('MassWateR')
```

The installation will take a minute or so to download.  You will see text and several messages in the console during the download.  Once it's finished, verify the installation worked by loading the package from your library. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(MassWateR)
```

## RStudio Cloud (optional)

If you can't install R or RStudio prior to the workshop, you can use use RStudio in the cloud. This is only a backup option and we strongly encourage you to troubleshoot the installation when able.

To use RStudio Cloud, copy this link and paste it in a web browser: <https://rstudio.cloud/project/4426781>

If you do not have an RStudio Cloud account, you will see this screen when you first visit the URL:

You can [setup an account](https://login.rstudio.cloud/register?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.login.rstudio.cloud%2Foauth%2Flogin%3Fshow_auth%3D0%26show_login%3D1%26show_setup%3D1) for free using a login you create or through a third-party (Google or GitHub).

After your account is setup, you should a screen that looks something like this:
